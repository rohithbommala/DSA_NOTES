Problem Description:
You are given an integer array arr of length n.
Your task is to make all elements of the array unique by repeatedly increasing any duplicate element by 1. Each increment operation can be applied multiple times if necessary.
Return the minimum possible sum of the array after making all elements unique.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// To find minimum sum of unique elements.
int minSum(int arr[], int n)
{
    int sum = arr[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1]) {            

            // While current element is same as 
            // previous or has become smaller
            // than previous.
            int j = i;
            while (j < n && arr[j] <= arr[j - 1]) {          
                arr[j] = arr[j] + 1;
                j++;
            }
        }
         sum = sum + arr[i];
     }

    return sum;
}

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1, 2, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Original sum = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
The second 2 is a duplicate â†’ increase it to 3.
Array becomes [1, 2, 3], sum = 6
